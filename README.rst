Unmixer: decompose an audio file into four tracks: *drums*,
*bass*, *vocals* and *other*.

Provides a Graphical User Interface to process musical
files through the `Open-Unmix
<https://sigsep.github.io/open-unmix/>`_ implementation
using the umx1 training data. Works best for pop music, but
tests on messy black metal tracks show acceptable results.
